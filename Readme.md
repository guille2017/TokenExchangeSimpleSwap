# Explanation of the Solidity Token Exchange and Swap Contracts

This project consists of two main Solidity contracts that enable token creation, liquidity pooling, and token swapping, similar to decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Uniswap. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the code, suitable for a README.md file.

# TokenExchange and SimpleSwap Contracts

## Overview

- **TokenExchange**: A basic ERC20 token with minting capabilities.
- **SimpleSwap**: A decentralized liquidity pool that allows adding/removing liquidity and swapping tokens.

---

## TokenExchange Contract

### Purpose
Creates a customizable ERC20 token with the ability for anyone to mint new tokens.

### Key Features
- Inherits from OpenZeppelin's `ERC20` and `ERC20Burnable`.
- Constructor initializes the token with a name and symbol.
- `mint()` function allows anyone to mint new tokens to a specified address.

### Code Highlights
```solidity
contract TokenExchange is ERC20, ERC20Burnable {
    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol) 
        ERC20(_name, _symbol)
    {}

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
}
```
- **Constructor**: Sets token name and symbol.
- **mint()**: Mints tokens to an address; accessible publicly.

## SimpleSwap Contract

### Purpose
Implements a liquidity pool that allows users to:
- Add liquidity (deposit tokens and receive LP tokens).
- Remove liquidity (burn LP tokens and retrieve tokens).
- Swap tokens within the pool.

### Key Concepts
- **Reserves**: The amount of each token held in the pool.
- **LP Tokens**: Represent share of the pool, minted when liquidity is added.
- **First Reserve**: Ensures the pool isn't empty at initialization.
- **Decimals**: Fixed-point math scaling factor.
- **Minimum Liquidity**: Locks initial liquidity to prevent exploits.

### Main Components

#### State Variables
```solidity
uint256 private constant FIRST_RESERVE = 1;
uint256 private constant DECIMALS = 1e18;
uint256 private constant MINIMUN_LIQUIDITY = 20_000;
```
- `FIRST_RESERVE`: Prevents division by zero during initial pool setup.
- `DECIMALS`: For precise fixed-point calculations.
- `MINIMUN_LIQUIDITY`: Locks initial liquidity to stabilize pool.

#### Events
```solidity
event LiquidityAdded(...);
event LiquidityRemoved(...);
event Swap(...);
```
- Emitted during adding/removing liquidity and swapping.

#### Constructor
```solidity
constructor() TokenFactory("LiquidityPair", "LP") {
    mint(address(this), MINIMUN_LIQUIDITY);
}
```
- Mints initial locked liquidity tokens.

### Functions

#### `addLiquidity()`

Allows users to deposit two tokens (`tokenA` and `tokenB`) into the pool and receive LP tokens.

**Process:**
- Checks current reserves; initializes with default if empty.
- Calculates optimal amounts to deposit based on current reserves.
- Transfers tokens from user to pool.
- Mints LP tokens proportional to deposit.

```solidity
function addLiquidity(...) external ensure(deadline) returns (uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB, uint256 liquidity) {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### `removeLiquidity()`

Allows users to burn LP tokens and retrieve their share of the underlying tokens.

```solidity
function removeLiquidity(...) external ensure(deadline) returns (uint256 amountA, uint256 amountB) {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### `swapExactTokensForTokens()`

Enables token swapping within the pool, swapping an exact amount of input tokens for output tokens, respecting minimum output constraints.

```solidity
function swapExactTokensForTokens(...) external ensure(deadline) {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### `getPrice()`

Returns the current price ratio of two tokens based on reserves.

```solidity
function getPrice(address tokenA, address tokenB) external view returns (uint256 price) {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### `getAmountOut()`

Calculates the output amount given an input amount and current reserves, following the constant product formula.

```solidity
function getAmountOut(uint256 amountIn, uint256 reserveIn, uint256 reserveOut) public pure returns (uint256 amountOut) {
    require(reserveIn > 0 && reserveOut > 0, "InsufficientReserves");
    return (amountIn * reserveOut) / reserveIn;
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Token Creation**: Users can create new tokens and mint tokens to themselves or others.
2. **Liquidity Pool Initialization**: The pool starts with minimal liquidity to prevent exploits.
3. **Adding Liquidity**: Users deposit token pairs, receive LP tokens representing their share.
4. **Removing Liquidity**: Users burn LP tokens to retrieve their proportional share of tokens.
5. **Swapping Tokens**: Users swap a fixed input amount for a maximum possible output, following the constant product formula (`reserveA * reserveB = constant`).

## Usage Tips
- Ensure the tokens used implement the ERC20 interface.
- Use `addLiquidity()` to provide liquidity, `removeLiquidity()` to withdraw.
- Use `swapExactTokensForTokens()` to perform swaps.
- Monitor reserves for price estimates.

## Summary
This set of contracts provides a foundational decentralized exchange mechanism, enabling token creation, liquidity provisioning, and token swaps on the Ethereum blockchain.
